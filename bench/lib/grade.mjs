// pass/fail per finding, with no model in the loop, so the same raw JSON always
// grades the same way and CI can gate on it.
//
// A criterion passes when EVERY group in `allOf` matches at least one of its
// alternatives. Groups exist so a criterion can require both the location and
// the failure mode (the project's stated grading rule).
