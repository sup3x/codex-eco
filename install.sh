# The old version copied over whatever was there, so a skill you had edited was
# gone without a trace and files removed from a newer release stayed behind for
# ever. This one moves the existing copy to a timestamped backup first - which
# also clears stale files, because the destination is recreated, not merged - and
# then verifies every installed byte against the source.
#
# Backups live in <parent of the skills dir>/.eco-backups, deliberately outside
# the skills directory: a copy named "eco-20260101-000000" sitting next to the
# real one would still say `name: eco` in its frontmatter, and the CLI would see
# two skills claiming one name.

Installs (or removes) the eco skills for Codex: eco and eco-max.
Both the Codex CLI and Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app read this directory.

Usage
  ./install.sh               install into ${CODEX_SKILLS_DIR:-$HOME/.agents/skills}
  ./install.sh --uninstall   remove the skill directories this project installs
  ./install.sh --help

An existing copy is moved to <parent of the skills dir>/.eco-backups/<name>-<utc stamp>
before anything is written, and the installed files are verified against the source.
