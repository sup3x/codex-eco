//
// /eco-max used to restate those rules by hand, and it drifted: six rules went
// missing, including the whole "verify and test" line - at the one effort level
// where guardrails matter most. Generating the shared block makes that class of
// drift impossible, and `--check` turns it into a CI failure instead of a
// discovery six releases later. The output style has the same rules again, so it
// is generated from the same block.
